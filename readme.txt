This project contains two UML diagrams, a Class diagram and a timing diagram.


## Synopsis
---------------
The class diagram shows the classes necessary for a given game, the functions that each one of these has and the interaction between them.
The timing diagram shows the interaction of the classes and their functions in a single frame of the game. It alsi shows the messages and alternative paths that may occur.
Both diagrams were done using the Unified Modeling Language.
